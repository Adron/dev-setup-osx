# dev-setup-osx

This is a repo of tools that I use to setup a development machine on OS-X. The easiest way to use this repository is to first clone it to your local machine. Then you'll have immediate access locally to all of the scripts and other content needed. To do that follow [these commands to get started]().

## Apple ID [Step 01]

[Instructions](Applie-ID/apple-id.md)

Setup an Apple ID that can be used for downloads related to patches, updates, Xcode things, Apple Updates, and related content. Create the Apple ID account related to that company to remove yourself from liability for any personal Apple ID content being used on the machine, this insures you're using only company owned products and you're not mistakenly using products that you might have registered on your own Apple ID account. To complete these steps and register an Apple ID follow [these steps](Applie-ID/apple-id.md).
