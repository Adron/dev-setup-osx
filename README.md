This is a repo of tools that I use to setup a development machine on OS-X. The easiest way to use this repository is to first clone it to your local machine.

## Apple ID [Step 01]

[Instructions](Applie-ID/apple-id.md)

Setup an Apple ID that can be used for downloads related to patches, updates, Xcode things, Apple Updates, and related content.

To complete these steps and register an Apple ID follow [these steps](Applie-ID/apple-id.md).
